Builds a custom version of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) server with the [lego-deprecated](https://github.com/caddy-dns/lego-deprecated) plugin included.

This allows Caddy to support all DNS providers handled by the [LEGO acme client](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/).

A docker image is built that supports `linux/amd64` only.
